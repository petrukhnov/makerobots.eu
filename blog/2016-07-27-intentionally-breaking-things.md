# Intentionally breaking things. 

Have you intentionally destroyed anything lately?

There is a mindset that breaking things is bad. Probably coming from past, when creating products were hard and tedious.
Now with mass production and excessive stock, many things become very cheap.

Breaking things is fun! I could identify several reasons:
  * Way to learn how things looks inside (e.g. disassembling rc helicopter, breaking toys to inspect joints).
  * Find and analyze weak points in structures. How much power need to be applied to bend something slowly but not breaking? How much pressure an item could survive? Without destroying, you never find limits.
  * To reuse parts in something different. Got old radio and need some motors/buttons/leds for next IoT project? ðŸ˜‰
