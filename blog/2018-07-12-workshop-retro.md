# 2018-07-12 workshop retro

We organized our first workshop in Helsinki 2018-07-09 where parents and kids explore motors and create robots together.

What went good
  * Many experiments with motors.
  * Everyone was eager to try how parts are work, and modify.
  * It was easy to connect motors.
  * Adding buttons or rheostats was fun.
  * 

What we could do better next time
  * Library doesn't have extension cord in room, better bring own.
  * Need usb cords/hubs with buttons. Much easier to turn of, then to unplug.
  * Long basic wires. Each one should have 4-7 long (30cm+) m-m wires.
  * Bring more simple lego parts 2x1, 4x1, etc.
  * Motors should have wires fixed (maybe even soldered). Many times they were disconnected on inaccurate moves.
  * For electronics/lego bxes: make pictures where each part should be placed. Will reduce cleanup time.
  * Think how everyone could keep his build (or at least bigger part of it).
  * Pre-program arduinos, so they could be used for basic operations.
  * Motor shields/drivers are highly required.
